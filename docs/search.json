Make sure you don‚Äôt delete or write over the speech marks.\r\nClick on the ‚Äòknit‚Äô command at the top of the pane. After a short wait you will see the output file of your work. Can you see your name on the output file?\r\nIf you can see your name, close the output file by clicking on X.\r\nIf you cannot see your name, drag the output file to the side so that you can see what you wrote in the Markdown file.

If so, close the output file by clicking on X.\r\nTyping in the code chunk\r\nWhen you write code in the code chunk, R will carry out the commands. Code chunks are named r chunk1, r chunk2 etc. You must write your code in the lines between the top row of and the bottom row of.\r\nWe will tell R to do a calculation for us. Type 10 + 2 into the code chunk. Click on the little arrow on the right of the code chunk to tell R to carry out the command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid R give you the correct answer?\r\nNow you make up an addition sum and type it into code chunk2.

After a short wait you will see the output file of your work. Check that the changes you made to the code have come out on the output file as you wanted them. eg You may have added a title for your bar chart in the code chunk in the R Markdown file, but perhaps the title has not been printed in the output file. Go back to the R Markdown file to check you put speech marks around it.\r\nOur data\r\nThis is the data we are going to use for the bar chart\r\nTable 1: Percentage of population with each blood group\r\nNow we will find out how to enter the data from the above table into R.\r\nCopy the following two lines of R code into chunk1 below. Make sure you paste the text between the top and bottom 3 back ticks.\r\nblood_group <- c(‚ÄòO‚Äô,‚ÄòA‚Äô,‚ÄòB‚Äô,‚ÄòAB‚Äô)\r\npop_percentage <- c(44,42,10,4)\r\nThe first line tells R to store these letters in a variable called blood_group\r\nThe second line tells R to store the percentages in a variable called pop_percentage.\r\nBlood Group\r\nO\r\nA\r\nB\r\nAB\r\nPercentage of population\r\n44\r\n42\r\n10\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nTo check what R has stored in the variable blood_group, type blood_group inside code chunk2 and select the arrow on the far right of the chunk. R will tell you what it has stored. It should be the four blood groups\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nNow check what R has stored in the variable pop_percentage by typing pop_percentage in code chunk3. Click on the arrow on the far right of the chunk. R will tell you what it has stored. It should be the four percentage numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nLet‚Äôs check the percentage numbers add up to 100.\r\nCopy sum(pop_percentage) into code chunk 4 and click on the little arrow on\r\nthe right of the chunk. What number does R print for you? Is it 100?\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nNow we will save the blood group and percentages data in a table (known as a tibble in R) called ‚Äòmydata‚Äô. This is so that the two variables can be combined into a single data table.\r\nCopy the following code into R chunk5.\r\nmydata <- tibble(blood_group, pop_percentage)\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nLets check that ‚Äòmydata‚Äô has the correct information in it.\r\nType mydata into code chunk6 and then click on the arrow on the right. Does the computer show you a little table with the correct information in?\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nDrawing a bar chart using our blood group data\r\nNow we have entered the data and checked that the data is correct we can tell R to plot a bar chart using these data.\r\nCopy and paste the three lines of R code into chunk7 and click on the little arrow on the right.\r\nggplot(mydata) +\r\naes(x=blood_group, y=pop_percentage) +\r\ngeom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô)\r\nWhat does this code mean?\r\nggplot means ‚Äòdraw me a graph‚Äô\r\nmydata means ‚Äòuse the numbers in the mydata tibble‚Äô\r\naes is short for aesthetics and means ‚Äòwhat I want to see is‚Ä¶‚Äô\r\nx=blood_group means ‚Äòplot blood group on the x axis‚Äô\r\ny=pop_percentage means ‚Äòplot percentage of people on the y axis‚Äô\r\ngeom_bar means ‚Äòthe graph I want is a bar chart‚Äô\r\nstat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô means ‚Äòmake the bars as tall as the y values in the tibble‚Äô\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nCheck your bar chart. Are the bars black?\r\nWriting labels and title\r\nNow lets alter the labels and add a title so that the bar chart is clearer.\r\nCopy and paste the following R code into chunk8 then click on the little arrow on the right.\r\nggplot(mydata) +\r\naes(x=blood_group, y=pop_percentage) +\r\ngeom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô)+\r\nylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the population‚Äô)+\r\nxlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô)+\r\nggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood Groups‚Äô)\r\nYou have added some more instructions for R. What do they mean?\r\nylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the population‚Äô) means ‚Äòmake this the label for the y axis‚Äô\r\nxlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô) means ‚Äòmake this the label for the x axis‚Äô\r\nggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood Groups‚Äô)means ‚Äòmake this the title for the barchart‚Äô\r\nNote how there is a plus sign after each command\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nCheck your bar chart. Are the labels correct? Is the title correct? Are the bars still black?\r\nWell done!\r\nChanging the colour of the bars\r\nLet‚Äôs make it prettier.\r\nLet‚Äôs make the bars red.\r\nCopy and paste the R code below into chunk9 and click on the little arrow on the right\r\nggplot(mydata) +\r\naes(x=blood_group, y=pop_percentage) +\r\ngeom_bar(stat = ‚Äòidentity‚Äô, fill = ‚Äòred‚Äô)+\r\nylab(‚ÄòPercentage of the population‚Äô)+\r\nxlab(‚ÄòBlood group‚Äô)+\r\nggtitle(‚ÄòUK Population Blood Groups‚Äô)\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nAre the bars red?
